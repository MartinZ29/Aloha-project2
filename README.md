#About project2

This is the second project I've done. Add more sections in the website.

Most importantly, I did it in the mobile-first way, with min-width 600px for table, and min-width 1240px for desktop.

In this project, I practise a lot about CSS/ CSS3, and add a little JavsScript.

And first time use flexbox instead of float.

## updates

1.Add Alert when subscribing, and prevent redirect to other pages.

2.Make navi bar fixed at the top of the pages when scoll down.

3.Add jQuery for smooth scrolling when use navi bar to redirect to the sections.

Welcome for all advices.
